Welcome to the Canner project
=============================

Canner is an open source framework for creating snapshots of network
devices from a variety of vendors. Commands are issued to the device and
the raw output and logs are saved in a directory snapshot or "can".
Device properties from the output files are tagged and saved in the
snapshot.
